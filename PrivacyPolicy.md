# TouchRefWatch - Privacy Policy

**Touch Ref Watch Overview:**
Touch Ref Watch is a standalone WatchOS Application.  It does not have or require an iOS companion app, it does not have a web portal, it does not have any kind of web back end.  The entire functionality of the app is self contained on your watch. 

This app was initially produced for my own personal use, and is now being supplied free of charge to support the referee community.

**What data does Touch Ref Watch Collect?**
During use, Touch Ref Watch App will read heart rate, active energy burned, and distance ran via Apple Health Kit.
No other data is collected by the application.

**What is this data used for?**
Heart rate, active energy burned, and distance is used by the App to record the workout within the Apple Fitness application.

Additionally, In order to allow the application to run in the background (and provide haptics for 1 minute warning and end of half etc) an extended runtime session is required. [Apple - Extended runtime sessions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/using_extended_runtime_sessions)

Since touch refereeing is too vigarous for these options, a Health Kit Workout Session is used to provide full functionality of the app [Apple - HK Workout Session](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkworkoutsession)

**Will the data be sold or passed on to third parties?**
This data is stored only on your Watch/iPhone within the Fitness app.

Touch Ref Watch does not communicate any data to any third parties or back to the developer.

If you wish to delete your data, you can do so via the Fitness App by deleting the workout session.

# TouchRefWatch - How To

**Modes - Competitive vs Casual**
Touch Ref Watch has 2 main modes, competitive and casual.

Casual allows you an infinite length game where you can set the duration of play time, and the duration of rest.  This is ideal for social touch sessions.

Competitive contains a variety of options, where you can set half length, half time length, touch down turnaround or regular games, drop off type and score keeping.

**Timing Method**
The timing in all modes is a continuous counter, and provides a 1 minuute warning for end of session (half, half time, game, etc).  The continuous time allows it to stay consistent with hooters at centrally timed tournaments.  No longer do you ahve to remember how many extra minutes the first half went for to figure out how long you have before the second half starts.

**Game Type**
There are 2 game types for competitive play, TD Turnaround and 2x Half.

2x Half is a regular game, and you have the option to set the half length, and half time duration.

TD Turnaround allows you to set the entire game length, and has no option for half time duration.

**Drop Off options**
There is a toggle for FIT 5 drop off, with the default (off position) being FIT 4.  Both provide haptic feedback every 2 minutes until the minimum number of players is reached.  The only difference in the FIT 4 and FIT 5 option is the number of starting players (displayed on the match screen).

Drop off is presented as an option at the end of the game.

**Score keeping**
Useful for local tournaments or games such as in training sessions where there is no other score keeping method.  Select the teams by their dominant kit colour.  The current score will be displayed on the screen.

To increase the score long press (for a duration of greater than 1 second) the team you wish to add a score for.  To decrement the score, double tap the team you wish to decrement.

Note: Disabling score keeping allows for a larger text size of the timer.

**Haptic Feedback**
Haptic feedback is the primary method of communicating to you the status of the game.

You will receive the following haptic feedbacks from the watch.
1 buzz for a 1 minute warning.  You will get this 1 minute away from half time, until start of the next half, and until the end of the game.

(Half Time only) - 1 buzz at 15seconds.  You will receive an additional warning buzz 15 seconds before the second half is due to start.

2 buzzes - This will be felt when the second half starts.  You will also feel this during the drop off, for each 2 minute interval where a player needs to leave the field.

3 buzzes - Played at the end of the first half, and end of the match only.

**Workouts**
Each game records your activity and stores this as a workout in your Fitness app.  This can easily be deleted via the Fitness app like any other workout.

As this application continues to run in the background should you return to the setting screen without ending the game you will be prompted to end it at the menu so as to not waste battery life.
